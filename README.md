## HelloWorld

This project serves as an example for the introduction to Java programming.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default. This folder is not tracked by git so it wont appear here in github.
